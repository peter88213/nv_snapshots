- Saving a snapshot is manually triggered via `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`S` or a "File" menu command.

## Requirements

## Download and install

### Default: Executable Python zip archive

Download the latest release [nv_snapshots_v0.8.0.pyzw](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_snapshots/raw/main/dist/nv_snapshots_v0.8.0.pyzw)

#### Important

This starts the installation.

If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
the zip file.
