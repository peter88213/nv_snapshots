# ![S](icons/snapshot.png) nv_snapshots

The [novelibre](https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre/) Python program helps authors organize novels.  

The *nv_snapshots* plugin provides a lightweight version control for *novelibre* projects.

## Features

A snapshot is a compressed, titled, and commented version of a `.novx` file.

- *nv_snapshots* creates such snapshots on demand and stores them 
  in a subdirectory of the project folder.
- With the snapshot manager, you can select individual snapshots and export documents from them 
  for comparison with the current project.
- You can also easily revert to a snapshot.

## Requirements

- [novelibre](https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre/) version 5.29+

## Download and install

### Default: Executable Python zip archive

Download the latest release [nv_snapshots_v5.0.2.pyzw](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_snapshots/raw/main/dist/nv_snapshots_v5.0.2.pyzw)

- Launch *nv_snapshots_v5.0.2.pyzw* by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop),
- or execute `python nv_snapshots_v5.0.2.pyzw` (Windows), resp. `python3 nv_snapshots_v5.0.2.pyzw` (Linux) on the command line.

#### Important

Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file and offer to open it immediately. 
This starts the installation.

However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
the zip file. 


### Alternative: Zip file

The package is also available in zip format: [nv_snapshots_v5.0.2.zip](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_snapshots/raw/main/dist/nv_snapshots_v5.0.2.zip)

- Extract the *nv_snapshots_v5.0.2* folder from the downloaded zipfile "nv_snapshots_v5.0.2.zip".
- Move into this new folder and launch *setup.pyw* by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop), 
- or execute `python setup.pyw` (Windows), resp. `python3 setup.pyw` (Linux) on the command line.
